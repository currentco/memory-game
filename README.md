## Idea behind the project

I have converted a static version of the Memory Game project to an interactive one by modifying the given HTML, CSS and JS files.


## Functionalities of the game

Memory Game Logic

- The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

Congratulations Popup

- When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.

Restart Button

- A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

Star Rating

- The game displays a star rating (from 1 to 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays three stars. After some number of moves, it changes to a two star rating. After a few more moves, it changes down to one star.

Timer

- When the player starts a game, a displayed timer also starts. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

Move Counter

- Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
